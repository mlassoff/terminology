    "IDE or Integrated Development Environment is a software application that provide an integrated set of tools for software development. There are several IDE's that specialize in a particular language or technology. For example X-Code allows programmers to use the languages Swift and Objective C to build applications that run specifically on Apple products.",
    "Software that allows you to record changes to a set of code and enables recall to an earlier version of your code base. Git is a commonly used version control software.",
    "Guidelines for specific programming languages and technologies that recommend best practices for code style, documentation, testing, software architecture and naming conventions.",
    "A collection of resources used to build applications. Libraries may include prewritten code, precomplied code or templates that are used in the development process, often doing “heavy lifting” within a particular development technology.",
    "Frameworks often provide a generic high-level implementation for software in certain problem areas. The Frameworks are meant to be modified to create specific solutions within a problem space.",
    "In coding vocabulary, tools are used to make certain parts of the software development process easier for the programmer. A debugger is a tool used to aid in finding bugs within software.",
    "Programming languages provide a particular vocabulary and set of syntax for developing applications. Common programming languages include Javascript, C, and Ruby.",
    "An individual image element that will appear in an application. Most often associated with game programming a sprite might represent a single state in an animation of a character walking.",
    "JSON is an acronym for Javascript Object Notation. JSON is a platform independent, all text, platform neutral way of exchanging data between systems. Because JSON notation is generic, it is free from a particular system implementation. It is used commonly with many different platforms."
